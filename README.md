This is my first Android app project. I haven't have chance of creating an Android app
and SQL database in my school classes. Why not study by myself? With curiosity and insterest, 
I build this app. This app is only supporting the devices with screen size of 6.0, 1080 x 2160, 400dpi.
A good example would be the size of "Pixel 3a XL." The features are written under 
the installation process, be sure to check it!


----- Installation Process -----

0. Download this app from the Github website to your PC (I am sure you already did).
1. Plug your phone to your PC by the USB cable. 
2. Drag the Apk file from your PC to your Phone. 
3. You can now use the app. Enjoy!


----- Features -----

It has the following features (with the updates):

----- Ver1.0 -----

Login & Lotout System - It requires the users to insert their username and password in order to login. If the users 
decide to exit this app, simply, click the logout sign on the bottom of the main page. 

Registeration System - It allows the first time users of this app to create a new account by requsting the
following data inputs, name, password, email, date of birth, country, and gender. Another user with existing username
and email cannot register a new account.

SQLite Database - It stores all the exising user information, in numerical order (old to new).

Current Date - It shows the current date and current time. The cloack values actually tik-toks!

Clickable Cute Llama Icon - Click it and check the surprise!

Phone Calling System - This is the main feature; it allows the users to call the others!

Music Player(with Volume & Progress Slides) - Users can listen to a beautiful music! The app provides 
play and not play buttons. While the music is playing, the users can adjust the volume and the progress of the 
music by the slide buttons. Currently, there is only one song available!

Portrait & Landscape Modes - Just like the other mobile apps, this app supports portrait and landscape views
(normal and side views). 

Japanese Localization - It supports Japanese translation. It works finely with your device, if the laugage setting 
is in Japanese.
